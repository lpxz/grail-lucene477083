 * <li> implementation of RAM-based indices;
 * <li> implementation indices stored in a database, via JDBC;
 * <li> implementation of an index as a single file;
 * </ul>
 *
 * Directory locking is implemented by an instance of {@link
 * LockFactory}, and can be changed for each Directory
 * instance using {@link #setLockFactory}.
